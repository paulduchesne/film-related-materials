They have in common that they are not part of the actual film (the one that are screened in a cinema or in another context). Therefore thay have often been referred to in negative terms by film archives: as non-film objects. Howevere, since they are as important as the film itself and are often used by researchers, publishers and others, FIAF recommend the term: \u201cFilm related materials\u201d. The cataloguing and documentation commission (CDC) has identified six basic categories of film related items. All of them common in most film archive collections. They are:</p> <ul> <li>Posters</li> <li>Stills/Photographs</li> <li>Scripts</li> <li>PR-materials</li> <li>Documents</li> <li>Objects</li> </ul> <p>Since the publication of the first FIAF cataloguing rules for film, there has been a demand for instructions of how to manage and catalogue film related items. However due to the diversity of the material it is not feasible to create cataloguing rules as such. The CDC has instead choosen to create lists of relevant metadata for each category. Each scheme is divided in three levels, \u201cfair\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbest practice\u201d. Of course archive institution shall always strive for the best, but knowing that resourses are limited it should be of use to know whats\u2019s concidered good enough. Again with respect to different economical as well as technical conditions, it is possible to use the metadata schemes regardless of collection management system. They will work for databases as well as card catalogues.</p> <p>The metadata schemes are supplemented with value lists. The value lists are to be indvidually createt and should be designed to reflect the collection. However when possible controlled terminology shall be used.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>More notes about this project?</p>"},{"location":"documents/","title":"Documents","text":"Documents (definition) = Papers or sets of papers with written or printed information AND/OR computer files in which text is stored (Cambridge dictionary) Unnamed: 1 Unnamed: 2 Fair Good Best practice Unique Identifier/Item no.

Song booklets were also widely popularised in other regional film industries, mainly in Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and others. The song booklets are very important as research materials, as they contain an extensive list of cast and crew and the official synopsis of the film, which is also added along with the songs. Most of those booklets also bear the announcement of upcoming films by the studio on the back cover. 16 Still (photography) Photographic or digital image 17 Storyboard Illustrations\u00a0displayed in sequence for the purpose of\u00a0pre-visualizing\u00a0a\u00a0film 18 Synopsis Brief summary of the content in a film 19 Unique identifier An\u00a0identifier\u00a0that is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for specific objects or entities and for a specific purpose.
