# Film related materials – Best practices
## Preface

Film related materials is a collective term that refers to a broad variety of objects related to cinematographic works, agents or the film industry. They have in common that they are not part of the actual film (the one that are screened in a cinema or in another context). Therefore thay have often been referred to in negative terms by film archives: as non-film objects. Howevere, since they are as important as the film itself and are often used by researchers, publishers and others, FIAF recommend the term: “Film related materials”. The cataloguing and documentation commission (CDC) has identified six basic categories of film related items. All of them common in most film archive collections. They are:

- [Posters](posters.md)
- [Stills/Photographs](stills.md)
- [Scripts](scripts.md)
- [PR-materials](pr_materials.md)
- [Documents](documents.md)
- [Objects](objects.md)

Since the publication of the first FIAF cataloguing rules for film, there has been a demand for instructions of how to manage and catalogue film related items. However due to the diversity of the material it is not feasible to create cataloguing rules as such. The CDC has instead choosen to create lists of relevant metadata for each category. Each scheme is divided in three levels, “fair”, “good” and “best practice”. Of course archive institution shall always strive for the best, but knowing that resourses are limited it should be of use to know whats’s concidered good enough. Again with respect to different economical as well as technical conditions, it is possible to use the metadata schemes regardless of collection management system. They will work for databases as well as card catalogues.

The metadata schemes are supplemented with value lists. The value lists are to be indvidually createt and should be designed to reflect the collection. However when possible controlled terminology shall be used.
