| 15 | Songbooklet            | A song booklet is a booklet, as the name suggests,  published with the songs of the films, written in four Indian languages, i.e., English, Gujarati, Urdu, and Hindi. The booklet cover was designed by the publicity artists for the film, hence has significance in the study of artwork. Song booklets were also widely popularised in other regional film industries, mainly in Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and others. The song booklets are very important as research materials, as they contain an extensive list of cast and crew and the official synopsis of the film, which is also added along with the songs. Most of those booklets also bear the announcement of upcoming films by the studio on the back cover. |
